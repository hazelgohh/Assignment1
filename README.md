# Designing Process
This website is for anyone who is trying to get some information on the band, knowing what kind of songs they perform to, the type of song they produce as well as some background information on the band themselves, the members. What i plan to achieve with this website is to make finding information on the band easier, putting any contact info they have on public to anyone who plans to book them to make the process easier with all the information complied into one website.
